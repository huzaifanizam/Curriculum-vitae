              Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
              outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice
              climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy
              mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.

              When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
              movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a
              large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
              advancements in the front-end web development world.
